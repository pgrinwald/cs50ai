## Layer 1, Head 4

This layer seems to be paying close attention to the relationship between the
preposition (e.g. after, during) and the noun (e.g. testing, training).

Example Sentences:
- The existing strategies represent different [MASK] after testing was complete.
- The two approaches share the same [MASK] during training.

## Layer 2, Head 5

This layer seems to be paying close attention to the relationship between the
noun (e.g. strategies, approaches) and the verb (e.g. represent, share).

Example Sentences:
- The existing strategies represent different [MASK] after testing was complete.                                         - The two approaches share the same [MASK] during training.
